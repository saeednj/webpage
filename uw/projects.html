                Here are some of the projects that I worked on:

                <h2>Algebraic Fault Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                In this project we looked at algebraic fault analysis of SHA-1
                and SHA-256 functions. Our contribution was enhancing a SAT
                solver to better perform at AFA of these functions.  We used a
                programmatic interface and developed callbacks for improving
                propagation and conflict analysis using SHA-specific knowledge.
                Our paper on this work has been accepted to <b>CP 2018</b>.
                </p>

                <h2>Checked-C and Android</h2>
                <p>
                This was my internship project at Google. I have done a
                feasibility study on using Checked-C programming language to
                detect/prevent out of bounds memory accesses bugs in Android's
                kernel.
                </p>

                <h2>MapleCrypt</h2>
                <p>
                MapleCrypt is a SAT-based tool I developed for preimage of
                SHA-1. It uses a CEGAR-based approach to reduce the complexity
                of the problem. Also we developed a multi-armed bandit restart
                policy, which turned out to be effective for cryptographic
                instances. Our paper on this tool was published in
                <strong>VSTTE 2017</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>MapleAmpharos</h2>
                <p>
                MapleAmpharos is an extension to the AMPHAROS parallel SAT
                solver. I have used a splitting heuristic based on propagation
                rate of variables. Also improved the solver by diversifying
                worker restart policies.  It is not beating the
                state-of-the-art, but is very competitive.  Our paper on this
                solver was presented at <strong>SAT 2017</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>SMS Center</h2>
                <p>
                SMSC was the main project that I contributed to during my time
                in Peykasa Co.  Although my work was on core C++ libraries that
                were also used in other similar networking products like SMS
                Mediators.
                </p>

                <h2>FMC Test</h2>
                <p>
                This was my internship project at Iran Air. I worked with
                automated test equipment centers (ATEC), and developed a test
                program for power supply card of flight management computer
                (FMC) of a Fokker 100. I wrote the code in ATLAS programming
                language.
