                Here are some of the projects that I worked on:

                <h2>MapleCrypt</h2>
                <p>
                MapleCrypt is a SAT-based tool I developed for preimage of
                SHA-1. It uses a CEGAR-based approach to reduce the complexity
                of the problem. Also we developed a multi-armed bandit restart
                policy, which turned out to be effective for cryptographic
                instances. Our paper on this tool was published in <strong>VSTTE 2017</strong>.
                </p>

                <h2>MapleAmpharos</h2>
                <p>
                MapleAmpharos is an extension to the AMPHAROS parallel SAT solver. I have used a splitting heuristic based on propagation rate of variables. Also improved the solver by diversifying worker restart policies.
                It is not beating the state-of-the-art, but is very competitive.
                Our paper on this solver was presented at <strong>SAT 2017</strong>.
