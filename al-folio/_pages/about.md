Currently I am working with AWS Security team as an applied scientist.
Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Waterloo.
I got my PhD in Computer Engineering from University of Waterloo working with professors [Vijay Ganesh](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh) and [Catherine Gebotys](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/people-profiles/catherine-h-gebotys-peng) on parallel SAT-based Cryptanalysis.
Also, I got my Master's degree in Computer Engineering from Shahid Beheshti University with professor [Ghassem Jaberipur](http://facultymembers.sbu.ac.ir/jaberipur/) on Redundant number systems.

My main experiences and broad research interests are in SAT solvers, Cryptography, Hardware/Software security, High Performance Computing, Compiler Security, Software Verification, and Computer Arithmetic.

I was born in Tehran, Iran, and now living in Seattle, US.  My name, Saeed, in native script is written like: سعید  and is pronounced like [s@ i:d] in IPA ASCII phonetics. My last name is also read as [ne dZa:ti].

I infrequently write blog posts [here](https://saeednj.github.io/blog/).
