Currently I am working with AWS Security team as an applied scientist. Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Waterloo, working on
parallel SAT solvers with professor [Vijay Ganesh](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh). I got my PhD in Computer
Engineering from University of Waterloo with professors Vijay Ganesh and
[Catherine Gebotys](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/people-profiles/catherine-h-gebotys-peng)
on SAT-based Cryptanalysis and parallel SAT solvers. I got
both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Engineering from Shahid
Behesti University, Tehran, Iran.

I was born in Tehran, Iran, and now living in Seattle, US.  My name,
Saeed, in native script is written like: سعید  and is pronounced like [s@ i:d]
in IPA ASCII phonetics. My last name is also read as [ne dZa:ti].

I sometimes write blog posts [here](https://saeednj.github.io/blog/).
