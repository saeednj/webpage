I am currently a PhD candidate at University of Waterloo,
working on SAT-based Cryptanalysis and parallel SAT solvers,
with professors [Vijay Ganesh](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh) and
[Catherine Gebotys](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/people-profiles/catherine-h-gebotys-peng).
I got both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer
Engineering from Shahid Behesti University, Tehran, Iran.

I was born and raised in Tehran, Iran but currently live in Waterloo, Canada.<br>
My name, Saeed, is an Arabic word, but commonly used in Iran as a first name.
In Arabic it means happy/merry, but in Iran it generally means blessed.
In native script it is written like: سعید and it is pronounced like [s@ i:d] in
IPA ASCII phonetics. My last name is also read as [ne dZa:ti].

I sometimes write blog posts [here](https://saeednj.github.io/blog/).
