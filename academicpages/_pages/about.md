I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at University of Waterloo,
working on parallel SAT solvers with professor [Vijay Ganesh](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~vganesh).
I got my PhD in Computer Engineering from University of Waterloo with professors
Vijay Ganesh and [Catherine Gebotys](https://uwaterloo.ca/electrical-computer-engineering/people-profiles/catherine-h-gebotys-peng)
on SAT-based Cryptanalysis and parallel SAT solvers.
I got both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer
Engineering from Shahid Behesti University, Tehran, Iran.

I was born in Tehran, Iran, and now living in Waterloo, Canada.<br>
My name, Saeed, in native script is written like: سعید and is pronounced like [s@ i:d] in
IPA ASCII phonetics. My last name is also read as [ne dZa:ti].

I sometimes write blog posts [here](https://saeednj.github.io/blog/).
